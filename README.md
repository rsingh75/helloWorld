Hello All,

1. This is a simple demonstration of server client communication (Chatbot).
2. The server can manage at max 2 clients(I have put the limit for 2)
3. Server is able to communicate with the individual clients independently.
4. This server needs to be handled by a person to give the response for the client's query.


PROCESS to demonstration

1. Always open server first
2. Start opening the terminals for client as well
3. server.C is source code for server
4. server is binary file for server.C
5. client.C is source code for client
6. client is binary file for client.C

PROCESS to terminate the connection

1. If the client is done with his query, He/She can type exit or EXIT
